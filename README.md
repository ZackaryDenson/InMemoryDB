# In-Memory Database with Transactions

## Overview
This Python script implements an in-memory key-value store with basic transaction capabilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script using Python: `python InMemoryDB.py`

## Example
Refer to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in `InMemoryDB.py` for the example tests.

## Future Modifications
- Require the database to support different types of values, not just integers.
- Require more realistic error handling for transactions instead of just throwing errors and canceling transactions.
- Consider requiring concurrency control to manage multiple people accessing the database at the same time.
